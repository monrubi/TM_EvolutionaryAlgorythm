# TM_EvolutionaryAlgorythm
Project developed with 2 classmates with code guidance from professor Angel Kuri.
It takes a short String, turns it to binary and creates a Turing Machine (also in binary) able to replicate the same string.
It includes the interface to assign the values needed to do the fitting and the population size.
First machines are created by randomizing. The first best is used to create the next gen.
The number of gens is also manually assigned. A report (in spanish) is annexed to show the best values found to assign.
Repository is new as program was written in Repl.it to be able to run it with real-time changes being updated.
